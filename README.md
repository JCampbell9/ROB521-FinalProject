# ROB521-FinalProject
Stacks 9 blocks into 3x3 patterns, spelling out letters.

Original functionality (built off of Josh's codebase)
- CameraPerception.py labels blocks in the frame
- Camera_Motion.py moves the arm accordingly
    - test_motion.py tests out this basic functionality

Final project functionality
- final_test.py reads from stacking_info.json to stack blocks into letters
    - stacking_coord_test.py was used to determine the proper coordinates and demo the functionality
